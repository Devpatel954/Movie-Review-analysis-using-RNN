## üß† Model Architecture

The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was built using the **TensorFlow Keras API** with the following architecture:

- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vector representations (embeddings)
- **LSTM Layer**: 64 units, captures sequential dependencies in the text data
- **Dropout Layer**: 0.3 dropout rate to prevent overfitting
- **Dense Layer**: 32 neurons with ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron with Sigmoid activation for binary classification

### **Training & Optimization**
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy

- **Accuracy**: 90%
- **Precision**: 88%
- **Recall**: 91%
- **F1 Score**: 89%

These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately classifying movie reviews as positive or negative, making it a reliable tool for sentiment analysis.
